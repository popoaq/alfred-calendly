# Alfred workflow for Calendly

Forked from https://github.com/promptworks/alfred-calendly

An unofficial workflow for Calendly for **single use links**. 

## Usage

## Implementation Notes

### API key

By default the API key is stored in `~/.config/calendly/api-key`.
This can be changed via workflow's environment variable.

### Icons

The icons are generated from the colors that Calendly lets you choose for your event types.

To update the icons, update the list of colors in `generate_event_color_icons` and rerun the script.
Please optimize the images after generating them via ImageOptim or something similar.

## Contributing

PRs welcome.
